When communicating with users, you can use Markdown syntax to format your text and make your messages more engaging. Here are some tips:

- To create a heading, start the line with one or more `#` symbols, followed by a space and your heading text. For example, `# My heading` will appear as a large, bold heading.

- To create a list, use `-` or `*` followed by a space and the list item. For example, `- First item` or `* Second item` will create a bullet-point list.

- To emphasize text, use asterisks or underscores around the text. For example, `*italic*` or `_italic_` will appear as italicized text, while `**bold**` or `__bold__` will appear as bold text.

- You can also create links using `[link text](https://example.com)`. For example, `[Click here](https://example.com)` will create a hyperlink with the text "Click here."
